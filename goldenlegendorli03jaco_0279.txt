THE GOLDEN LEGEND 267

went into 3 desert named Granmonte‚ and lived , ς „325”
there 3 great while in pure conscience and in holy
contemplation, but, as he led this life, there grew '
on him a great tribulation that he had great fear

that the tranquillity of his contemplation might be
troubled, and went into an abbey of Citeaux and
there he was professed, and profited much in
virtues from then forthon, and after, he was there
made prior. Afterward he was translated from
thence into another abbey that is called Karo-
losenee, and there by election he was chosen abbot.

And there in all humility he treated debonairly

his disciples and subjects‚ in showing to them
examples of good virtues and good manners..
After, he was chosen to be archbishop of Bourges,

and how well it was against his will, he accepted

it 3 nevertheless when he had accepted and taken

it, yet therefore changed he not the habit of the
order which he had tofore taken, ne the observance

also. And how well that he had meats delicious
enough, as to such a prelate be ordained and
arrayed, nevertheless he left not the soberness

that he had maintained tofore, in humility, in holy
meditation‚ and in devout prayers, in which gladly
always he occupied his time. And he was much

busy for the health of the souls that were com-
mitted to him and charged to keep3 gladly and
diligently he heard their confessions, he nourished
them sweetly, oft and diligently· he preached to
them or did do preach. He deserved so much
grace of our Lord that b his devout prayers

and merits in his living lie God showed many
miracles.
