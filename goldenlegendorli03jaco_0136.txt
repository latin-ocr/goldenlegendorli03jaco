124 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

morrow shalt thou suffer martyrdom for our Lord's
sake. And as he went again towards the prison
at Greenwich, early by the morrow, his keepers
that had sought him all the night met him, and
anon they cast him down to the ground and
there they wounded him full piteously. And then
they brought him again to prison, and they made
therein a great smouldering of smoke for to disease
him. And then S. Dunstan appeared to him and
bade him be of good comfort, for our Lord hath
ordained for thee a glorious crown. And as they
spake together his bonds brake, and all his wounds
were made whole again through the mercy of our
Lord Jesu Christ, and when his keepers saw this
they dreaded full sore. And anon this miracle
was known to the people and they went then fast
to see him. And the judges doubted the great
people that came thither, and they took him out of
prison and led him to that place where he should
be martyred, but the poor people made great
lamentation for him. But anon the wicked tor-

smote him on the head that he fell to the ground,
and then rendered up his spirit to our Lord Jesu
Christ. And then these wicked tyrants threw the
holy body into a deep water that good men should
not find it, but by the providence of our Lord,
within short time after he was found of the true
christian men, and they reproved greatly these
wicked tyrants. And they began then to scorn
the holy body and one of ⁷ them tookan old rotten
stake or tree,‘a'nd pight it in the >(ῗξῑζίὴ and said:
