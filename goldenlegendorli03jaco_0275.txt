THE GOLDEN LEGEND 263

better hand to receive the alms. Then S. Loye The
said to him that he should put forth that other L1feof
hand, which as well as he might he put forth. S· Loye
S. Loye took and handled it and anointed it with
a little oil, and anon it was guerished and whole.

Another time when he had given to the poor
people all the gold and silver that he had, many
other poor men came and demanded of him alms :
and beholding himself that he had no more to
give, anon he departed among them a mark of
gold that he had borrowed of his neighbour‚ and
anon after, came more poor folk to demand alms,
he put his hand anon to his pur-se, for he re-
membered not that it was void, and by the will
of God he found therein a mark of gold, and
when he had found that he began greatly to thank
our Lord God thereos, and distributed it and
departed it to the poor people for the love of God.

He was of high stature, red of visage and
angehe, of simple and prudent regard and cheer.
At the beginning he was clad with precious vest-
ments of gold adorned with gems and ouches‚ and
ware gilt girdles with precious stones, but under
that, on his bare flesh, he wore always the hair.
After this he gave all his pree-ious vesture to the
poor people for to succour them in their necessities‚
and from then forthon he used always simple and
poor clothing‚ and oft despoiled himself for to
clothe the poor people. And when the king saw
him in such wise he gave to him his own vest-
ments and girdleS‚ for he loved him as his proper
soul, and abandoned to him all his house, and
commanded to all his folk that all that S. Loye
would have should be delivered to him without
delay, and all he gave and distributed to poor folk,
prisoners and to sick.
