Here fhlloweth qs S. Mark the Evangelist, andfirst

the interpretation of his name.

Mark is as much to say as high to command-
, ment, certain, declined, and bitter. He was high -
⁴, of commandment by reason of perfection in his
life, for he kept not only the commandments
common, but also the high as be counsels. He
„ was certain in the doctrine of the gospel, like as
he had received of S. Peter hiswmastess he was
declined by reason of peffec't 'and *great* humility‚
for because of great meekness he cut 9ff <hi8>⁷sshssmb2.v

anT‘Bitter pain, for he was drawn through the
city, and among those torments he gave up his
spirit. Or Mark is said of a great mallet or
beetle‚ which with one stroke maketh plain iron
and engendereth melody, and confirmeth it. For
S. Mark by his only doctrine quencheth the un-
steadfastness of the heretics‚ he engendered the
great melody of the praising of God‚ and confirmed
the church.
