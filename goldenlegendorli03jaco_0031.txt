THE GOLDEN LEGEND 19

from the place. It is read that S. Ignatius in all
his torments and all the pains of martyrdom that
he suffered, that his tongue never ceased to name
the name of Jesus, and when they that tormented
him demanded him wherefore he named this name
so oft, he answered: Know ye for certain that I
have in my heart this name written, and therefore
I may not leave to name this name oft. And
because hereof, when he was dead, they that heard
these words opened his body and drew out his
heart and cut it open, and they found within the
name of Jesus written with fair letters of gold, for
which miracle many received the faith of Jesu
Christ.

Of this saint saith S. Bernard upon the psalm,
Qui habitat: S. Ignaffius, martyr of God glorious‚
is of great merit, which was minister to the disciple
that Jesus so much loved‚ and in his episdes, the
which he sent to the glorious Virgin Mary, he
saluted her as mother that had borne Jesu Christ,
and she resaluted him again, in sign that he was a
person of great honour, of great dignity, and of
great authority. The body of whom was honor-
ably buried of christian men, to the worship of
Jesu Christ which is blessed in secula seculorum.
Amen.
