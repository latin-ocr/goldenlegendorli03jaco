4 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

their heart should be hurt by fleshly will. And
she chastised them that were nice and quaint,
saying that such nicety was filth of the soul, and
said also that, word sounding to any ordure or filth
should never issue out of the mouth of a virgin,
for by the words outward is showed the counten-
ance of the heart within, and she that so spake and
was rebuked therefor, if she amended it not at the
first warning, ne at the second, ne at the third, she
should be dissevered from the others in eating and
in drinking, by which she should be ashamed, and
thus should be amended by debonair correction,
and if she would not, she should be punished by
right great moderation. She was marvellous de-
bonair and pitiful to them that-were sick, and
comforted them and served them right busily, and
gave to them largely to eat such as they asked,
but to herself she was hard in her sickness and
scarce, for she refused to eat flesh, how well she
gave it to other, and also to drink wine. She
was oft by them that were sick, and laid the
pillows aright and in point, and frotted their feet
and chauffed water to wash them. And her
seemed that the less she did to the sick in service,
so much less service did she to God, and deserved
less merit, and therefore she was to them pitiful,
and nothing to herself. In her right great sick-
nesses she would have no soft bed, but lay upon
the straw or upon the ground, and took but little
rest. For the most part she was in prayers both ’
by day and by night, and she wept so much
that it seemed of her eyes a fountain. So many
tears ran ,from them, and when we said to her
oft-times that she should keep her eyes from weep-
ing so much, she said: The visage ought to be
like to be foul because it hath so much been made⁴
