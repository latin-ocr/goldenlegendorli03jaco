100 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

called herself ancille or handmaid, and not ladv
Much people 1s humble ln low estate and but few
nhigh estate, that is to wit in great estates, and
therefore is humility more praised 111 them that be
great in estate, as soon as she said: Lo! here the
handmaid of God, let it be done to me after thy

time that she had thuso given her assent to the
angel, she conceived in her Jesu Christ, which 1n
that same hour was in her, perfect man and
perfect God 1n one person; and as wise as he was

happened also, as well tofore as after, these things
that hereafter be named. On that same day
Adam, the first man, was created and fell into
original sin by 1nobed1ence and was put out of
paradise terrestrial. After, the angel showed the
conception of our Lord to the glorious Virg‘ 011]
Mary. Also that same day of the month Cain
slew Abel his brother. Also Melchisedech made
offering to God of bread and wine in the presence
of Abraham. Also on the same day Abraham
offered Isaac his ⁷son.⁷ That same day S. John
Baptist was beheaded, and S. Peter was that

⁷day⁷ delivered out of prison, and S. James the

more, that day beheaded of Herod. And our
Lord Jesu Christ was on that ,day ‘cfrfici‘fiess
wherefore that is a day of great reverence. Of
the salutation that the angel brought to the glorious
Virgin, we read an example of a noble knight
which for to amend his life gave and rendered him-
self into an abbey of Citeaux, and, forasmuch as he
was no clerk, there was assigned to him a master
for to teach him, and to be with the brethren
