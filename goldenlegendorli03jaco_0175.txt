THE GOLDEN LEGEND 163

that who was taken on the sea, and brought so in The
against his will, should be at the will of the lord, Life of
body and goods. And when Vespasian saw him S· james
he demanded him what he was and from whence
he came3 he said that he was of Jerusalem. Then
said Vespasian: Ah Lord God! in that country
were wont to be good masters and much gooo
surgeons3 my friend, said he, canst thou anything oi
surgery? This said he because he had in his nose
a botch full of worms from his youth, and never
might man be found that might heal him of it.
The messenger of Pilate answered and said that he
could nothing thereos. Vespasian said: If thou
heal me not I shall slay thee. The messenger
said: He that enlumined the blind, and chased
devils out of men, and raised dead men to life in
our country, knoweth well that I cannot heal thee,
but he can well heal thee if he will. Then
demanded Vespasian what he was. He said to
him that it was Jesus of Nazareth, whom they of
Jerusalem had slain wrongfully for envy, and if
thou wilt believe in him he shall heal thee. Then
said Vespasian: I believe well that he that raised
dead men may well heal and make me all whole3
and saying these words the wasps fell from his,
nose with the botch within which they were, and
”forthwith he was made perfectly whole, whereof
he had much great joy and said: I am certain
that'he‘ that hath thus made me whole was the
very son of God. I shall demand licence of
the emperor Tiberius, and Ι shall go destroy
the cursed traitors that have slain this man3 and
then he let Alban, the messenger of Pilate, go
where he would.

After this Vespasian went to Rome, and gat
licence of the emperor for to destroy this people
