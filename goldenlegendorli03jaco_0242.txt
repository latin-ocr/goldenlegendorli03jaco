230 THE GoLDEN LEGEND

The Lives offer to thern and do sacrifice. Then anon were
ogsaints they brought and led forth for to sacrifice; and
ervgffi then Gervase said that all the idols were deaf and
Prothase dumb, and that he should require help of Almighty
God. Then the earl was wroth and commanded
him to be beaten with scourges of lead so long till
he gave up his spirit, and so suffered death. Then
he commanded Prothase to be brought to him, to
whom he said: Thou cursed wretch‚ now think to
save thy life and die not an evil death with thy
brother. To whom Prothase said: Who is a
wretch? I that dread thee not, or thou that
dreadest me? To whom Astasius said: How
’ should Ι dread thee, wretch? To whom Prothase
said: In that thou dreadest me, that thou shouldest
vbe hurt by me if Ι make not sacrifice to thy gods;
if thou dreaded not to be hurt of me thou wouldest
never compe] me to the sacrifice of idols. Then
the provost commanded him to be hanged on a
gibbet. Then said Prothase to him: Ι am not
angry with thee, for I see thine eyes of thine heart
blinded, and Ι have great pity of thee because
thou seest not what thou doest, but do that thou
hast begun, that this day the benignity of our
Saviour may bring me to my brother. Then the
earl commanded him that his head should be
smitten off, and thus he suffered martyrdom for
our Lord. Philip, a servant of Jesu Christ, with
his son, took the bodies and buried them secretly
in his house in a tomb of stone, and laid a book at
their heads containing their nativity, their life, and

their end.
And they suffered death under Nero about the
year of our Lord fifty-six. These bodies were
hid there many years, but in the time of S.
Ambrose they were found in this manner.
