THE GOLDEN LEGEND 283

two have all night exposed them in lechery, and The Life
this is the cause that wherefore we be entered into 0f S· ,
them. S. Marcial, at the request of the prince and Marma!
people‚ healed them.

This same year, that is to say the fortieth year
after the passion of our Lord Jesu Christ, the
same, our Lord Jesu Christ, appeared to him and
showed how that hastily he should depart from
this world, and be with his other friends in the
realm of heaven. Then he did do assemble all
the christian people that he had converted, and
to them made a much sweet sermon in taking
leave of them. Soon after he was 'sick of the
fevers, and then our Lord appeared to him with
a great quantity of angels, which with much joy
and gladness bare the soul of S. Marcial into
heaven: Ubi est honor et gloria in secula secu-
lorum, Amen. This S. Marcia] of whom we speak
here was the same child, as some say, on whom
our Lord laid his hand upon his head, when the
contentiori and strife was among the apostles which
of them should be greatest in the realm of heaven,
and then our Lord set the child Marcial in the
midst of them, laying his hand upon his head, as
said is, and said to them: If ye be not little and
humble as this child is, ye shall not enter into
heaven3 he that shall be least among you he shall
be greatest in my realm‚ as the gospel maketh
more plain mention. The which glorious S.
Marcial let us pray unto, that he procure unto our
Lord Jesu Christ, that all we may have part with
him in the joy and glory perdurable. Amen.
