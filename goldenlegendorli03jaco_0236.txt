224 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

⁶ The idols to fall down and slew many. The emperor
ιῑέἓῗῃῖξ was afeard and smote himself on the breast with
Vitas and his fist saying : Alas ! alas! a child hath overcome
Modestus me. Then came an angel that unbound them and
they found themselves by a river, and there resting
and praying rendered their souls unto our Lord
God, whose bodies were kept of eagles, and after-
ward‚ by the revelation of S. Vitus, a noble lady
named Florentia took the bodies and buried them
worshipfully. They suffered martyrdom under
Diocletian about the year of our Lord two hundred

and eighty-seven.

,It happed afterward that a gentleman of France
bare away the heads and put them in a chureh
which is a mile from Lusarches, named Fosses, and
closed thern in a wall unto the time that he might
set them more honourably. But he died ere he
might perform it, so that the heads were there
whereas no man living knew where they were.
It happed so after, that there was certain work in
that chureh, and when the wall was broken where
the heads lay and were discovered, the bells of
that chureh began to sound by themselves. Then
assembled the people to the chureh and found a
writing which devised how they had been brought
thither, and then they were laid more honourably
and set, than they were tofore3 and there then
were showed many miracles. Then let us pray to
these glorious saints that it may please them to pray
to God for us in such wise that we may by their
merits and prayers come to the glory of heaven, to
which bring us the Father and Son and Holy
Ghost. Amen.
