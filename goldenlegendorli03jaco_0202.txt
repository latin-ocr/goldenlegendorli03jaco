190 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The Life to tempt him in that craft. And in short time
⁰f S· after died king Athelstan‚ and Edmond his
Dun⁵ta¹¹ brother reigned king after him, to- whom S.
Dunstan was chief of counsel‚ for he gave to him

right good counsel to his life's end3 and then died
Edmond the king, and after him reigned his son

Edwin, and soon after S. Dunstan and he fell

at strife for his sinful'living. ’ F orv S. Dunstan
rebuked the king sharply therefor‚ but there was

none amendment‚ but always worse and worse.
Wherefore S. Dunstan was right sorry, and did

all that pain he might to bring the king to amend-

ment, but it would not be. Eut the king, within

a while after, exiled S. Dunstan out of this land, ³

and then he sailed over the sea and came to the
, abbey of S. Amand in France, and there he
dwelled long time in full holy life till king Edwin
was dead. And after him reigned Edgar king, a
full holy man. And then he heard of the holiness
of S. Dunstan, and sent for him to be of his eouncil,
and received him with great reverence, and ‚made
him again abbot of Glastonbury. And soon after
the bishop of Worcester died, and then S. Dunstan
was made bishop there by the will of king Edgar.
And within a little while after the see of London
was void, to which king Edgar promoted S.
Dunstan also, and so he held both bishoprics in
his hand, that is to wit both the bishopric of
Worcester and the bishopric of London. And
after this died the archbishop of Canterbury, and
then king Edgar made S. Dunstan archbishop of
Canterbury‚ which he guided well and holily to
the pleasureof God, so that in that time of king
Edgar, and Dunstan archbishop, was joy and
mirth through the realm of England, and every
man praised greatly S. Dunstan for his holy life,
