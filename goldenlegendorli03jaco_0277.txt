THE GOLDEN LEGEND 265

have we done for to let this man to be taken off
if God Almighty had not holpen us3 the soul
is yet in his body. When he was raised, he was
clad, and he did him to take his rest. When
they that had made him to die knew it, they would
have made him receive death again, and with great
pain S. Loye delivered him from their hands, yet
he gat letters of grace for. him, to be more sure.
There was a priest in his diocese which was in-
famed, and oft he reproved him and exhorted him
to be confessed, but the priest alway heled his sin.
When S. Loye saw that his fair admonition
availed not, he excommunicated and accursed him,
and defended him that he should no more sing
mass unto the time he had done open penance.
The priest set nought by his commandment ne
defence, in despiting his sentence. A little after
this the said priest would go sing mass, and as he
approached unto the altar, he fell down to ground
and died.

Many other miracles did he by his life and
doeth yet. He edified at Noyon the ancelles
of Jesu Christ. By him, God showed the body
of S. Quintin. He found at Soissons the bodies
of two brethren germanes, martyrs, S. Crispin and
Crispinian, and ordained a precious vessel to put
them in. He found also at Beauvais the body of
S. Luciam, which was of the company of S.
Quintin‚ which he put in a precious vessel. At
Paris, upon the great bridge, he made a blind man
to see. The sexton of the church of S. Colomba
at Paris, came to S. Loye and said to him that
thieves had borne away by night all the jewels
and parements of the said church. Then S. Loye
went into the oratory of S. Colomba, and said to
him: Hark thou, Colomba, what I say to thee;
