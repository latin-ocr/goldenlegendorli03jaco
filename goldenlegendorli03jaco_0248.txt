236 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The Lives repentance thereof unto her life's end. And after,
Of saints when the holy body had rested in the wall certain
ωέἶξὲἶῃ years, S. Edward appeared to an holy religious

phiabel man, and bade him go to Darne Ethelreda„ abbess
of that place, and say to her that she purvey that
his body should be laid in a more worshipful place.
And then she went to S. Dunstan to pray him of
his help in this matter, and soon after S. Dunstan
came with a multitude of bishops, abbots, priors
and of the clergy, and took up this holy body and
laid it in a worshipful shrine, which the abbess and
other well-disposed people had ordained for it.
And when his body was taken out of the wall,
there came out of the grave a savour like a smoke
of frankincense, smelling so sweet that all the
people were greatly comforted thereby. And

the year of our Lord one thousand, and somewhat

Edward his son reigned after him, which was a
holy and glorious king and confessor, and lieth
buried at Westminster, and worshipfully shrined,
whereas our Lord hath showed many a great

martyr S. Edward, king, and to S. Edward, king
and confessor that they pray to our Lord for us,
that we may in this wretched world so amend and
repent us of our wretched life, that, when we shall
depart hence we may come to his everlasting life
in heaven. Amen.
