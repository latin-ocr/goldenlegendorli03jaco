of S.

all the bones of the calf and laid them under the
skin, and after, made his prayers to God, and anon
then the calf arose all alive and whole as he was
tofore. And the next day after, S. Germain
demanded the king why he had forbidden him his
house, and the king was much abashed and could

wherein he lay, and said: I am in sweet rest and
abide the coming of the Redeemer. And he said
to him: Rest in peace in the name of our Lord,
and pray for us devoutly that we may deserve the

eholy joys of the resurrection. And when S.
