THE GOLDEN LEGEND 17

Of S. I gnatius.

S. Ignatius was disciple of S. John Evangelist‚
and was bishop of Antioch. And after that, as
some say, he sent a letter unto our Lady or an
epistle in this wise: Unto Mary the Virgin‚ that
bare Jesu Christ in her body, I, humble IgnatiUS‚
her servant, send greeting, I, that am yet a novice
in the faith and disciple to Jesu Christ and to
John thy dear friend, desire to have of thee some
comfort and consolation of some good enseignment
and teaching. For of Jesus thy Son I have

heard say many mawels, of which I am enjoyed ’

to hear only of thee, which hast been always in
his company. Thou knowest well the secret
desires of him, thou hast been plainly informed,
and they that be yet young in the faith with me
trust much to be endoctrined of thee, and informed
in their creance and belief: Lady, God salute thee.
And to this letter answered the glorious Virgin
Mary in this manner: Ignafflus, good disciple of
Jesus and his special friend, the humble handmaid
of Jesu Christ sendeth to thee greeting. I do thee
to wit that all that John hath said to thee of
Jesu Christ and all that thou hast learned of him
is true doctrine and thing certain. Go alway in
good creance‚ and believe and keep firmly the
promise of thy christian faith‚ and do thy works
according to the same. I shall come with S. John
for to visit thee and other christian men with thee.
Hold thee always well in the faith and in good
works, and let no persecution ne adversity that thou
shalt suffer move thee from thy faith ne from thy
creance, but have solace and affiance in J esu Christ
thy Saviour. This was the answer of his letter.
S. I gnatius was a man right well learned,
