Here follow the Lives (gf S S. Quirine and Juliet.

Quirine was son of a noble lady of Iconium,
which lady would flee the persecution, and she
went with her son Quirine, which then was but
three years old, into the city of Tarsus in Cilicia.
And she was there presented to Alexander the
provost, and bare her child in her arms, which
when her two chamberers saw that, anon they fied
and left her alone. Then the provost took the
child in his arms, and Juliet his mother refusing to
do sacrifice, he made her to be scourged with raw
sinews. And when the child saw his mother
beaten he wept bitterly and made a lamentable
noise, but the provost took it in his arms and
danced it upon his knees, and would fain please
the child with kissings and fair words. The
child, alway beholding his mother, abhorred the
kissings of the provost, and turned his head away
from him with great indignation and scratched his
face with his nails, and gave his eries consonant
‘anto his mother, as he should have said: And I
am also christian. Then he bit the provost, and
wrestling with him all to-scratched him. Then
the provost‚ having indignation hereof and in a
great anger, threw down the child off the steps
whereas he sat in judgment, that the tendet brain
fell abroad out of his head upon the steps. Then
J uliet seeing her son go to heaven tofore her, gave
thankings unto God‚ and she was thereof right
glad. Then it was commanded >that Juliet should.
be flayed, and burning pitch cast on her, and at
the last her head to be smitten off. And it is
found in another legend that Quirine despised the
tyrant as well when he glosed him as when he
blamed him, and confessed him to be christian,
