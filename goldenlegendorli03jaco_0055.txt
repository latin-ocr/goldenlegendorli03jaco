this that I havessI give to you. 'Then he made The Life - ·
thern both whole by virtue of his prayer. It &alsdnfine
happed on a time he came into a church destroyed,
and found there a wolf among the bushes; and μμ]
he commanded him that he should go his way,
and anon he obeyed to him and fied, so that sith
that time he was not seen. At the last, when he
had eonverted much people‚ by his word and pre-
dication, to the saith of God, and also by good
ensamples showed evidently to the people, in the
fortieth year of his bishopric, he saw a dove of
fire that came from heaven to his house. And
by that he understood well that he should finish
and pass out of this world, and so he did, for he
died anon after, about the year of our Lord five
hundred and fifty. When his body should be
translated, S. Omer which was blind for age, was
sorry that he might not see the body of S. Vedaste
and anon our Lord enlumined him, and rendered
to him his sight. And he saw the body of S.
Vedaste. but anon after, he was blind again as he
had been tofore. Let us pray to him, etc.

Here beginneth the Lffi? ‘ff S. V alentine, and first the

interpretation of his name.

Valentine is as much to say as containing valour
that is perseverant in great holiness. Valentine
is said also as a valiant knight, for he was a right
noble knight of 'God, and the knight is said valiant
that fleeth not, and smiteth and defendeth valiantly
and overcometh much puissantly. And so S.
Valentine withdrew him not from his martyrdom
in fleeing, he smote in destroying the idols, he
defended the saith, he overcame in suffering.
