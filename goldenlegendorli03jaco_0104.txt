It happed another day that S. Benet went to
visit his sister, named Scholastica, and as they sat
at table she prayed her brother that he would
abide there all that night, but he in uo wise would
grant her, and said he might not live out of his
cloister. And when she saw that he would not
grant to her to abide, she inclined her head and
made her prayers to our Lord, and anon it began
to thunder and to lighten‚ and the air to wax dark
which tofore was fair and clear, and a great rain
fell down so that for nothing he might depart.
And like as she wept with her eyes, right so
forthwith the rain and storm came, and then she
lifted up her head. Then S. Benet said to his
sister: Almighty God forgive you that ye have
done, for ye have letted me that I may not depart
hence. And she said: Fair brother, God is
more courteous than ye be, for ye would not
accept my prayer, but God hath heard me, now
go if ye may. And then S. Benet abode there
all the night, speaking of God between him and
his sister without sleeping, till they were both
eased. On the morn S. Benet went to his abbey,
and on the third day he lift up his eyes to heaven,
and saw the soul of his sister mount up into heaven
in the likeness of a dove, and anon he did the
body of her to be brought to his abbey, and did
it to be buried in his tomb which he had do made
for himself.
