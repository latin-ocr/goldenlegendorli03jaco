276 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The Life plish commandments solitarieS. After this S. Peter

⁰f :53- came to Rome, and prayed to Marcial that he
manual would go with him, and thus as they had been
together endoctrined with one holy doctrine, and
of one meritorious dilection, in like wise that
together they receive the common reward of the
joy perdurable. And thus as they went they were
accompanied of some disciples of Antioch, among
whom were Alphinian and Austridiman, and many
other. When they were entered wlthin Rome,
they were received of a man named Marcel, at
that time consul of the Romans, Thus as they
dwelled there God appeared to S. Peter. and com-
manded him that he should send S. Marcia] into
the provinces of Gaul for to preach the saith and
the belief to the people which were in the bonds
ot the devil of hell. Then S. Peter called to him
S. Marcial and told him all by order that our

Lord had said and commanded him. When S.
Marcia] heard that, he began strongly to weep,
because he doubted the far region, and the people
which had no knowledge of God. When S.
Peter saw him thus weep he began much sweetly
to comfort him in saying to him: My holy
brother, be not heavy ne sorrowful, for God shall
be always with thee like as he hath promised to
us saying : Lo ! I am always and shall be With you
unto the consummation of the world. Thus, my
sweet brother, he commanded us after his resurrec-
tion saying: Go ye unto and through the universal
world and preach the gospel to all creatures‚ that
who shall believe and shall be baptized he shall be
saved, and they that will not do so shall be damned.
Which things, my blessed brother, behoveth us to
keep and put in effect, to the end that we forget
not the commandments of God. Anon after
