THE GOLDEN LEGEND 21

is signified to us a simple conscience and righteous, The

which maketh true judgment of the intention, for ἔέἑῑξὲἃ·

all works be good or evil. If they be done in evil our Lady

intention or by hypocrisy they be evil and without
profit, like as saith J esu Christ : If thine eye be evil,
all thy body shall be dark. By the eye is under-
stood the intention, with gEQlHCESJlHlElC’ and
debonairty is signified by the doves. We ought
also to offer a pair of turtles to our Lord, that is
to say, a chaste life and a very intention to leave
our sins, the which is signified to us by the chastity
of the turtle‚ and by her weeping the contrition.
As Bede saith : Contrition ought to begin in dread
and end in love3 for the soul faithful, when she
remembereth her sins in her conscience, she
weepeth for the dread of the pains of hell that
she hath deserved, and thus offereth she to God a
turtle3 and when she hath wept, there cometh to
her a hope to have mercy and pardon of her sins,
and this hope is conceived of dread in him and love
of God, to serve and to be in his company3 so that
soul that ought to sing, weepeth for love, which
hath delivered her so soon from the perils and
miseries of this world, and for to come to the
sweet company of our Lord. And thus offered
she that other turtle, in weeping with David the
prophet the long pilgrimages that she hath made
in the miseries of this world saying: Heu me quia
incolatus meus prolongatus est3 for when she
beginneth to think after the joyous company of
angels, and of the souls that be in heaven, and
what joy and* deduitrthat they have in the over-
desjrous sight of our Lord, then all the world
grieveth them, and they desire to be delivered from
the-*faits of the body for to go into the company
of these holy souls.
