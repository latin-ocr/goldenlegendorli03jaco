Here followeth the Life ῳ( S. Aldhelm.

S. Aldhelm the confessor was born in England.
His father hight Kenton3 he was brother unto
Ina, king of this land, and when king Ina was
dead, Kenton was made king after him, and then
this holy child Aldhelm was set to school in the
house of Malmesbury, where afterward he was
fisade abbot⁷.⁷ And then he ¹did there great eost
in building and did do make there a full royal
abbey. And when the pope heard of his great
holiness, he sent for him to come to Rome, and
when he was there the pope welcomed him and
was much glad of his good living, and there he
abode long time with the pope, and gat full great
privileges and liberties to the house of Malmesbury⁷
in such wise that no bishop ln England should visit
ne have to do there, ne the king to let 'them of
their free election‚ but chose their abbot among
the convent themselves. And when he had gotten
all this of the pope he was full glad and joyful‚
and lived there holily a long time. And on a
day he said mass in the church of S. John
Lateran‚ and when mass was done, there was no
man that would take his chasuble from him at the

tend of the mass. and then He saw the sunbeam
⁷ shine through the glass⁷ windowJ and hung his

chasuble thereon‚ whereof all the ⁷people marvelled

⁷⁷⁷greatly of that miracle, and the same chasuble is

yet at Malmesbury, the colour thereof ιε purple.
