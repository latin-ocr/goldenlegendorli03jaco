THE GOLDEN LEGEND 253

this holy soul from the body. And the paynims, The
persevering in their malice, threw alway stones at NatiVstY
the dead body: and anon after, fell a debate among (ἕ St· ’Ῐῖὴῦ
the paynims, that each fought with other, and in ap ¹⁵
the meanwhile a christian man stole away the body ΣΗ. ⁴
and hid it.

And anon after, our Lord showed a great
mimele, and that was that, the visages of the
tormentors were disfigured, their hands, arms and
other members dried up, and the judge lost his
mind and was mad, because they strove against the
will of God, and suffered great pain afterward.
And thus suffered these two holy martyrs‚ S.
Alban and S. Amphiabel, martyrdom and death
for the faith of J esu Christ, which by their merits
bring us unto his everlasting life. Amen.
