22 8 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The Lives all things gave to our Lord thankings; and at the
0f Samts last the brethren had pity on him and considered
-Θθτνέῃὲ his humility and patience, and did so much to the
pfothase abbot that he was taken into the monastery, and
all the offices that were most foul were enjoined

for him for to do. He took it all gladly, and all

things he did patient ly and devoutly‚ and at the

last, being full of virtuous life, she died and
departed out of this world. When they should

take up the body and wash it for to dispose it to

be buried they saw that she was a woman. All

they were astonied and feared, and knowledged

that they had trespassed greatly in the servant of

God. Then they ran all for to see the sight, and

asked forgiveness of their ignorance and trespass.

Then bare they the body of her into the church

and there honourably they buried it. Then she

that infamed the servant of God was taken and

veXed with a devil, and knowledging her sin came

to the sepulchre of the blessed virgin, and there

was delivered and made all whole. To whose

tomb the people over all there about came and
assembled, and there our Lord showed many
miracles for his blessed virgin Marine. She died

the fourteenth kalends of July.

Here follow the lives ‘ff SS. Gervczse and Prothase,
and first qf the interpretation of their names.

Gervase is said of gerar, which is as much
to say as a vessel, or holy, or of gena, that is to
say strange, and of syor, that is little, for he was
holy by merit of his life3 a vessel for to receive
virtues in himself ; strange by despising of the
world, and he was little by despising of himself.
