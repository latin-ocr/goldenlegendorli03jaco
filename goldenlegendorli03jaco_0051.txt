THE GOLDEN LEGEND 39

honorem deo dedit et patriae liberationem fecit3 The Life
which is as much to say: The holy saint Agatha 0f S·
had always holy thought and pure, and gave honor Agatha
to God with a free will in all her works, and pur-
chased by her prayers peace and deliverance to all
the country. After that the table containing this
scripture was set at her head, the young man and
all his company departed from the tomb, being
closed, without appearing any more afterward‚
wherefore it is supposed that this young man was
her good angel. This was published over all,
whereof the Jews and Saracens began to sing and
worship the sepulchre of the tomb of S. Agatha.
QuintianuS, the provost, died of an evil death in
the way as he went for to seek the goods and
riches of S. Agatha, and also for to have taken her
parentS, and never after could be known where
her body became. And for to prove that she had
prayed for the salvation of the country, at the
beginning of February, the year after her martyr-
dom, there arose a great fire, and came from the
mountain toward the city of Catania and burnt
the earth and stones, it was so fervent. Then
ran the paynims to the sepulchre of S. Agatha and
took the eloth that lay upon her tomb, and
held it abroad against the fire, and anon on the
ninth day after, which was the day of her feast,
ceased the fire as soon as it came to the eloth that
they brought from her tomb, showing that our
Lord kept the city from the said fire by the merits
of S. Agatha. To whom pray we that she by
her prayers may get and impetre grace of our
Lord to be kept from all perils of fire in this
world, and when we shall depart hence to eschew
the perpetual fire, and to come to the glory and joy
in heaven. Amen.
