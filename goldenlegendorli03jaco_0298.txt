286 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The Life live in virginity unto the death, as espouse of Jesu
0‚f S· Christ? The maid answered: Holy father, ye
Geneweve demand that I desire; there lacketh no more but
that by your prayers our Lord will accomplish my
devotion. The holy man said: Have firm belief
in God, and prove by works the good things, that
ye believe in your heart and say with your mouth,
and our Lord shall give you force and virtue. S.
Germain held his hand on her head till he came
unto the minster, there he gave to the people the
benison. S. Germain said to the father and mother
of the maid that they should bring her again on the
morn to him. When she was brought again on
the morn, S. Germain saw in her a sign celestial‚
I wot not what, and said to her: God thee
saluteth, Genevieve. Daughter‚ rememberest thou
what thou promisedst to me yesterday of the
virginity of thy body? Holy father, said the maid,
I remember well that, and by the help of God Ι
desire and think to accomplish my purpose. Then
the holy man looked on the ground and saw a
penny signed with the cross, which came by the
grace and will of God; he took it up and gave
it her and said: Fair daughter take this and bear
it in mind of Jesu Christ your espouse, and suffer
not about you none other arrayment of gold ne
silver, ne of precious stones, for if the beauty of
this world surmount a little your thought, ye shall
lose the goods of heaven. He commended her to
God‚ and prayed her that she would remember
him in her orisons and prayers, and recommended
her to father and mother. The two holy bishops
went from thence into England, where were
heretics against the faith, which said that children
born of father and mother baptized had no need
to be christened‚ which is not truth‚ for our Lord
