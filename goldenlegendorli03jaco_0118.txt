106 THE GoLDEN LEGEND

The

Life of Here beginneth the lffe of Mary qs Egypt.
S Mary Mary the Egyptian, which was called a sinner,

, Of Egypt led and lived the most straight life and sharp that

“ff ‘might be, forty- seven years in desert. In that
time was a good, holy and religious monk named
Zosimus, and went through the desert which lieth
beyond the flom Jordan and much desired to find
some holy fathers. And, when he came far and
deep in the desert, he found a creature which was
all black over all her body, of the great heat and
burning of the sun, which went in that desert, and
,that was this Mary Egyptiaca aforesaid. Biit as
soon as she saw Zosimus come, she fied, and
Zosimus after. And she tarried and said: Abbot
Zosimus, wherefore followest thou me? Have
'Pity and mercy on me, for I dare not turn my
face toward thee, because I am a woman and
also naked, but cast thy mantle upon me, by which
I may then, without shame, look and speak with
thee. And when Zosimus heard himself named
he was greatly amarvelled, and anon he cast to
her his mantle, and humbly prayed her that she
would give to him her blessing3 and she answered:
It appertaineth to thee fair father to give the
benediction, and nothing to me, for thou hast
the dignity of priesthood. When he heard that
she knew his name and his office, he had yet
more marvel, and of that she asked 5ο meekly his
blessing. After, she said: Blessed be God the
vSaviour of our 501115. Then she lift up her hands
¹unto heaven in making her prayer, and Zosimus
