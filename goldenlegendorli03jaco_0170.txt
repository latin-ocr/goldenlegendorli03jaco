158 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The believe S. Jerome. Then let us pray to the holy

Life Of apostle S. Philip that he pray for us to our Lord

that we may come to his bliss. Amen.

Herefolloweth of S. James the Less.

James is as much to say as supplantet or sup·
planting a feast, or making ready. Or James is
said of ja and of cobar, which is as much to say
as the burden or weight of God. Or J ames may
be said of jaculum, a dart and copis smiting, which
is to say smitten with a dart, or smitten with
glaives. He was said a supplanter of the world,
for he despised it in supplanting hastily the devil.
And he is said making ready, for always he made
ready his body to do well. For as Gregory of
Nyssen saith: We have in us three evil passions
which come of evil nourishing, or of right false
conversation, or of evil custom of the body, or of
the vice of ignorance, and they be cured by good
conversation, and for to haunt studies of good
exercitatior] of doctrine. So then the blessed
James is escried‚ for he was always ready in
his body to all good. He is said the burden or
weight of good or godly manners, that he used
by exercitatior] of virtues, He was smitten with
glaives by martyrdom.

J ames the apostle is said the Less, how well that
he was elder *of age than wass, James the More,
because like as is in religion ‚he that entered first is
called aine and great, and he that cometh after

shall be called less, though he be the older, and
