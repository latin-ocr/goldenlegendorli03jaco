274 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The Life that he wist not what to do, and did do assemble
0f S· all the butchers of the town, and gave to them an
Entrope hundred and fifty shillings for to put to death S.
Eutrope‚ and that they should bring again his
daughter to his house. Then, the day tofore the
calends of May, they assembled with them many
Saracens and came to the lodge of S. Eutrope‚
and first they stoned him, and after they beat this
holy man with staves and scourges leaded, all
naked, and after they cleaved his head with a
butcher's axe, and sawed him with a saW. The
maid with many others buried him by night in his
tigurion or lodge‚ and kept him in vigils with
lights, and in divine obsequieS, as long as she lived.
A little while after, she departed out of this world
right holily‚ and was buried beside her master as
she had required by her life. After this, a certain
space of time, they of Xaintes edified over this holy
corpse a much notable church‚ in which all sick
foll< of divers maladies and sicknesses have been
healed, and yet daily be, and also many prisoners
be also, by the prayer of this holy saint, delivered
of their irons, as gyves, bolts‚ and other, which be
hanged in the said church in remembrance that
they have been loosed and unbound by the prayers
of S. Eutrope. S. Denis wrote the passion and
martyrdom of S. Eutrope in Greek and sent it
into Greece, to his friends that believed there in
God, by the hands of S. Clement that then was
ΞΞΡΞΞΞ Κνῖιῖἷῖᾌὶῃψῖῗιῗὲῗῗὲεὲἓά ῗὲῗξζῖἶῗῖἳέ ἶῖἳιῖ
