222 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

· The bewield them. Then said the provost: Alas!
LWeS'Of alas! I have lost mine hands. Then said to him

Saints

Vitus and the child Vitus: Call thy gods and pray them that
Modestus they help thee if they may. Then said the

provost: Mayst thou heal me? The child
answered : Ι may well heal thee in the name of my
Lord Jesu Christ, and anon he made his prayer
and healed him.> Then said the provost to his
father: Chastise thy son, to the end that he die
not an evil death. Then his father brought him
again to his own house, and made come to him
harps, pipes and all manner instruments that he
might have, and after did do corne maidens for to
play with him, and made him to have all manner
’ of delights that he might get, to mollify and
change his heart. And when he had been shut
and enclosed in a chamber one day, there issued a
marvellous odour and sweet savour, whereof his
father and the meiny marvelled, and when the
father looked in to the chamber, he saw two angels
sitting by his son, and then said he: The gods be
come into mine house, and anon after these words
he was blind. Then assembled all the city of
Lucca at the cry of the father, and the provost
Valerian carne also, and demanded what it was
that was happed to him. And he said to him : Ι
have seen in my house the gods all so shining and
bright as fire, and because Ι might not suffer the
clearness‚ Ι am become blind. Then led they him
to the temple of Jove and promised unto him a
bull, with horns of gold, for to have again his sight.
But when he saw it availed him nothing, he required
his son that he would pray for him, and anon he
made his prayer unto God, and anon he was all
whole. Yet for all that he would not believe in God,
but thought how he might put his son to death.
