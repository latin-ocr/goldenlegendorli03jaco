THE GoLDEN LEGEND 237

a shipping in to Great Britain, which now is The L5ives
calledEngland, in the time of Cassibelaun‚ king 0f Samts
of the BritonS. And twice he was driven out, ἓὲὲἃέω
and the third time by the help of one Androgeus, phiabel ”
duke of Kent, he had victory and conquered the *5²52 Δ
realm and subdued it to Rome, and made it to ²⁰⁴
pay yearly tribute, and ordained and stablished
certain statutes in this land which were long
observed and kept. Among which he ordained
that none of this land should receive the order of
knighthood, but only at Rome by the hands of the
emperor, lest peradventure the rude people and
unworthy would take upon them that order un-
worthily, which is of great dignity‚ and also they
should make an oath never to rebel ne bear arms
against the emperor, which statutes were used in
all places obedient to Rome and under their
subjection. Then reigned in the land of Britain,
which is now called England‚ a king named
Severus, which for to please the emperor Dio-
cletian, who sent: his son that hight Bassianus with
many other lords' sons, of Cornwall, Wales, Scot-
land and Ireland‚ unto the number of a thousand
five hundred and forty, among which was a prince's
son of Wales in great array which hight Am-
phiabel‚ a goodly young man, and well learned
in Latin, French, Greek, and Hebrew. Also
there was in his fellowship a lord's son of the
city of Verulam named Alban, which was a well
disposed and seemly young man, and discreet in
his governance. And all this fellowship came
prosperously to Rome in the time when Zephyrus
was pope of Rome, which saw the great beauty of
this young company, and had compassion that they
were not christian, and laboured as much as he
might to convert them to the faith of Jesu Christ.
