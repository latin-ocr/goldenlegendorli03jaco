118 THE GoLDEN LEGEND

The Life they named secretly among themselves, that unnethe
Οἷς· they themselves heard 1t Simplician. S. Ambrose
Ambrose was far from them, they weened that he might not
have heard them, and he cried on high thrice:
He is old and he is good. When they heard him
they were much abashed and departed, and sith
after his death they chose the same Simplician for
the good witness that S. Ambrose had borne of

him.

A bishop which was named Honorius, that abode
the death of S. vAmbrose, slept and heard a voice
that thrice called him and said: Arise thou up for
he shall go his way anon. Then he arose anon
hastily and went to Milan and gave to him the
holy sacrament, the precious body of our Lord.
And anon S. Ambrose laid his arms in form of a
cross and made his prayers, and so departed and
gave up his ghost among the words of his prayers,
about the year of our Lord three hundred and
eighty, the vigil of Easter. And Ψ11611 his body
in the night Ψ33 borne 111 10 1116 church many-
children that were baptlzed saw him, as they said,
sitting in a chair honorably, and others 311οΨ6(1
him with their fingers 10 their father and others,
and some said that they saw a star upon his body.
There was a priest, that sat 31 meat with others,
which said not well of him, but missaid, but anon
God so chastised him that he was borne from the
table and died anon after. In the city of Carthage
were three bishops together at dinner, and one of
them spake evil by detraction of S. Ambrose, and
there was a man that told what was befallen for
such language to this aforesaid priest, but he
mocked and japed so much that he felt a stroke
morta13 that that same day he died and was

buried.
