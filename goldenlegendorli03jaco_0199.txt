fair and beauteous, and by the will of her father she Ψ ³
was vexed with the fevers and aXeS. It happed on
a time that the disciples dined with S. Peter, and
one, Titus, said to him: Peter, how is it that all
sick people be healed of thee and thou sufferest
Pernelle, thy daughter, to lie sick? To whom S.
Peter said: For it is expedient to her to be sick;
nevertheless because it shall not be imputed im-
possibility of her health for to be excused by my
words, he said to her: Arise, Pernelle, hastily,
and serve us 3 which anon arose all whole and
ministered and served them. And when the
service was all done and complished, Peter said
to her: Pernelle, go again to thy bed; who anon
went again to her bed, and the fevers vexed her as
they did tofore, and whereas she began to be
perfect in the love of God so he healed her
perfectly. Then was there an earl called Flaccus
which came to her, and for her beauty would have
her unto his wife. To whom she answered: If
thou desirest me to have unto thy wife, command
thou certain virgins to come to me for to accom-
pany me unto thine house. And whiles he was
busy to make ready the said maidens, S. Pernelle
set herself in fastings and prayers, and received the
holy body of our Lord and reclined in to her bed,
and after the third day she died, and she passed
out of this world rendering her soul unto our Lord.
Then Flaccus, seeing himself disappointed and
mocked, turned himself unto Felicula, fellow of
S. Pernelle, and said that she should wed him or
offer unto the idols‚ which both two she refused.
