98 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

Feast with thee. There is not found in Scripture in
⁰f the no part such a saluing. And it was brought from
Annunt‘}²}''1i heaven unto the glorious Virgin Mary, which was
the first woman that ever in the world offered to

God first her virginity. And the angel said to her

after: Thou shalt be blessed above all other
women, for thou shalt escape the malediction that

all other women have in childing in sin and in
sorrow3 and thou shalt be mother of God, and

shalt abide a pure virgin and clean. And our
blessed Lady was much abashed of this salutation‚

and thought in herself the manner thereof. This

was a good manner of a virgin that so wisely held

her still and spake not, and showing example to
virgins, which ought not lightly to speak, ne with-

out advice ne manner to answer. And when the

angel knew that for this salutation she was timorous

and abashed, anon he repeaced her, saying: Mary,

be nothing afeared, for thou hast found soothly
grace at God, for thou art chosen above all women

for to receive his blessed Son and be‘mother to
God, and moyenffanddadvocate for to set peace
between God and man, foi· mtoi'destrosy' the death

and bring the life. O thou that art a virgin, saith

S. Ambrose, learn of Mary to be mannered and
fearful to all men, learn to be still and to eschew

’ all dissolutions.

Mary was afeared of the salutation of the angel,
the which said: Thou shalt conceive and bring
forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, and
he shall be called the Son of God. And Mary
said to the angel: In what manner may this be
that thou sayest? For I have purposed in mine
heart that I shall never know man, and yet I never
knew none, how then shall I have a child against
the course of nature, and may abide a virgin?
