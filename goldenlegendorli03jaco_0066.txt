power to release some pains gf penzince enjoined

for the sins confessed, and for these three causes he

is digne and worthy honorably to be served and

worshipped. Let us then pray to him that he may

impetre and get to us remission of all our sins, and

after this short transitory life we may come to

everlasting joy and glory in heaven. Amen.

Of S. Matthias the Apostle, and first the

interpretation qf his name.

Matthias in Hebrew is as much to say as given
to our Lord, or a gift of our Lord, or else humble
or little. For he was given of our Lord when he
was chosen from the world, and was set and
entetssssssjmfflg „the,‚,bssseye11*ty-LWQ. discipleffi he was
also given of our Lord when he was chosen by lot
and numbered among the apostles. He was little
for he had all very meekness in him and humility.
There be three manners of humilities‚ as S.
Ambrose saith that: The first is of the afflietion
by which a man is made humble3 the second is
consideration of himself, and the third is of the
devotion which is of the knowledge of his maker.
S. Matthias had the first in suffering martyrdom‚
the second was in despising himself, and he had
the third in amarvelling the majesty of our Lord.
For Matthias is said as doing good for evil, for he
being good was set in the place of J udas the
traitor. And his life is read in holy church‚ and

Bede writeth it as many holy men bear witness. l
