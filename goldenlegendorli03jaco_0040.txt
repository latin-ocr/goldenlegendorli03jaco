¹The whereof they were all abashed and showed this to

SLssflzgg their lord, the which anon sent many knights for

' him, and commanded to bring him and all the

christian men with him. And that night Jesu

Christ appeared to him thrice‚ which said to him:

Arise up and make to me sacrifice. Lo! here be

the knights that corne to fetch thee at the com-

mandment of the prince. And the knights said

to him: Come out from this place, the president

calleth thee. And S. Blase answered: My sonS‚

ye be welcome, I see now well that God hath not

forgotten me. He went with them and continually
preached, and did many miracles tofore them.

There was a woman that had a son dying, in

· whose throat was a bone of a fish athwart‚ which
estrangled him, and she brought him tofore his
feet, praying him that he would make her son
whole.⁷ And S. Blase put his hand upon him
and made his prayer to God that this child, and
all they that demanded benefits of health in his
name, that they should be holpen and obtain it,
and anon he was whole and guerished.

Another woman there was that was poor which
had a swine, which the wolf had borne away, and
she humbly prayed to S. Blase that she might
have again her swine. And he began to smile
and said: Good woman anger thee not, for thou
shalt have again thy swine, and anon the wolf
brought again to the woman, which was a widow,
her swine.

And anon after he was entered into the city,
the prince commanded to put him in prison, and
after another day he made him to come tofore him,
whom he saluted by fair words, saying to him:
Be thou joyful, Blase, the friend of God. S.

Blase answered to himz Be thou joyous right
