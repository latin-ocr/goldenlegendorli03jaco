THE GOLDEN LEGEND 93

On a night as S. Benet was in his prayer at a The

window‚ he saw the soul of S. Germain, bishop
of Capua, mount into heaven, and like as a light
sudden that enlumineth all the darknesses of the
world, so the light of that soul gave a great light ;
and after he knew that the soul of S. Germain
passed that same hour. After this, whenthjumev
came that S. Benet himself „ should depart outffof
this world, he showed it to his monks six days
tofore‚ and did do make his pit. Andafter' that
3 fever took him strongly, which held him every
day, and at the sixth day he did himself to be
borne to the church, and there received the body
of our Lord Jesu Christ, and after, among the
hands of his disciples, his own hands lifting up to
heaven in making his orison, he rendered his soul
unto his creator. The same hour was a revelation
showed to two monks, for they saw a way to
heaven all covered with palls and mantles of gold,
and full of torches burning which illumined all the
heaven, which came from the cell of S. Benet unto
heaven. And there was 3 man in 3 fair habit to
whom these monks demanded what way that was,
and he answered· that it was the way by which
S. Benet mounted up to heaven. T hen the body
of S. Benet was buried in the oratory that he had
made of S. John, where as was wont to be the
altar of Apollo, the year of our Lord five hundred
and-eighteen. To whom let us pray devoutly
ῑΒὲὗ he pray to our Lord for us, that we may
have grace after this life to come to everlasting
bliss in heaven. Amen.
