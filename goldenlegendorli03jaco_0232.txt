220 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The Life he was much contrary to them and would not
⁰f S· suffer them enter into the temple. After this,
Barnabas Barnabas saw on a day men and women, being

all naked, running through the town, and made
then great feast, whereof he was much angry and
gave his malediction and curse to the temple, and
suddenly a great part thereof fell down and slew
a great part of the people. At the last S. Bar*
nabas came into the city of Salome, but this
enchanter aforesaid moved the people greatly
against him, so much that the Jews came and
took him and led him through the city with great
shame, and would have delivered him to the judge
of the city for to punish him and to put him to
death. But when they heard say that a great
and a puissant man was come in to the city, which
was named Eusebius, and was of the lineage of
the emperor Nero, the Jews had doubt that he
would take him out of their hands and let him
go, and therefore anon they bound a cord about
his neck, and drew him out of the city, and there
anon burnt him, but yet the felon Jews were not
satisfied to martyr him so, for they took the bones
of him and put them in a vessel of lead, and would
have cast them into the sea, but John, his disciple,
with two other of his disciples went by night into
the place and took the holy bones and buried thern
in an holy place. Then, after that Sigbert saith,
they abode *in that place unto the time of the
emperor Zeno and Gelasius the pope, that was the
year of our Lord five hundred. After that then,
as S. Dorotheus said, they were found by the
revelation <of S. Barnabas himself, and were from
thence translated in to another place, and S.
Dorotheus saith thus: Barnabas preached first at

Rome of Christ, and was made bishop of Milan.
