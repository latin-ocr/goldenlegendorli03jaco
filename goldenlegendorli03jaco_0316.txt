304 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The Life had no hope of life. In great weeping and sorrow

0‚f S· they brought him thither requiring aid of the holy
Geneweve virgin. Anon after their prayer, the stone issued,
and he was forthwith all whole as he had never
been sick. Another man came thither that gladly
wrought on the Sunday, wherefor our Lord
punished him, for his hands were so benumbed
and lame that he might not work on other days.
He repented him and confessed his sin, and came
to the tomb of the said virgin, and there honoured
and prayed devoutly‚ and on the morn he returned
all whole, praising and thanking our Lord, that by
the worthy merits and prayers of the holy virgin,
grant and give us pardon, grace, and joy perdurable.
After the death of the blessed virgin S. Genevieve
was assigned a lamp at her sepulchre in which the
oil sourded and sprang like water in a well or
rountain. Three fair things showed our Lord by
this lamp, for the fire and light burned continually,
the oil lessed not ne minished, and the sick
people were healed there. Thus wrought our
Lord by the merits of the blessed virgin corporally‚
which much more abundantly worketh by her
merits to the souls spiritually. Many more
miracles hath our Lord showed at her sepulchre
which be not here written, for it would be over
long to remember them all, and yet daily be
showed, wherefore in every necessity and need let =
us call on this glorious saint, the blessed Genevieve,
that she be mediatrix unto God for us wretched
sinners, that we may so live and amend us in this
present vlife that we may come when we shall
depart hence by her merits unto the life perdurable

in heaven. Amen.
