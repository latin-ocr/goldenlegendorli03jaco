The one, and presented that other without more.

Life of When S. Benet had received the present he

S· genet thanked him much and said to him: F air brother,

take good heed how thou shalt do with that which

thou hast hid, and drink not thereof for thou

knowest not what is therein. Then he was

ashamed, and so confused went from him, and

when he carne to the place where he had hid it,

he would wit what was therein like as S. Benet

had told to him, and bowed it a little, and anon a
serpent issued out.

It happed on a time that S. Benet ate, and a
young manffwhich *was son-to >agr-eat lord held to
him a candle, and began to think in his heart who
&this-that> Lserve ? Ι am son unto a great man3
it appertaineth not that one so gentle a man as I am
be servant to him. When S. Benet saw by ex-
perience the pride that arose in this monk, he
called another monk and made him to hold the
candle, and after said to him: What is that thou
hast? bless thy heart brother, bless it, God forgive
it thee, now thou shalt serve me no more3 go into
thy cloister and rest thee there.

There was a man of the king of Goths which
was named Gallas, which tormented over cruelly
the christian men, because he was of the sect of
the Arians, in such wise that where he found
clerks or monks he slew them. Then it happed
on a day that he tormented a villain or a carle for
the covetise of his good3 when the carle saw that
he would take all, he gave all that ever he had to
S. Benet. Then left Gallas to torment him a
little, buthe bound him with the reins of his
bridle, and drove him tofore, and he rode after till
that he came to the abbey of S. Benet, and bade
him that he should show to him this Benet.
