The Life
of S.
William

268 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

On a day it happed that a priest named Gerald
had lost the health of one of his hands, that he
might sing no mass, which came to S. William,
and S. William bade him that he should confess

him and without doubt he should be whole, and so

’ he did, and at the end of three days he sang mass

whole and sound‚ Another time there was a
young child that had his brain sore troubled‚ in
such wise that his eyes turned in his head; his
friends brought him tofore this holy man, on whom
he had great pity and began humbly to handle him
and laid his hand on his head, and anon the pain
ceased and he was anon all whole. He was
always glad and joyous, and that displeased much
to some that were of hard and rude living. Above
all things the sin of detraction displeased him
much, and he loved no detractors, and to his
power, with great diligence, he made them to
eschew this sin, and where they would not he
withdrew him from their company. Finally he
took the cross for to go over sea against heretics
and heathen men, and as he made his purveyance
for to make the said voyage, he rendered and gave
up his soul to Almighty God, the fifth ides of the
month of January, and was buried in the church
of BourgeS‚ the which anon after, began to do
miracles. When the pope Honorius the third
heard his life, and how God showed miracles for
him, after that he by great diligence had made
inquisition, he canonised him to the honour and
Esaissfiissffssssihgwlsschtss'ysssse ἔέἓέἱῖζῗῑὲζ iliisssaifi
heaven. ’ Amen.
