The Life
of S.
Pet-nelle

186 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

verted three captains of the town with the keeper
of the prison, which was named Anofinus, and
baptized them. When the tyrant heard that
Anolinus was become christian, he did do bring him
tofore him, and because he would do no sacrifice to
his gods he did do smite off his head. And when
S. Urban and his fellows were brought tofore the
idols‚ to the end that they should sacrifice and cense
tofore the gods, S. Urban began to make his orison
to God3 and anon the idol fell down and slew
twenty—two priests of the law that held fire for to
make sacrifice. Then were they beaten crueHy,
and after brought for to make sacrifice, and then
they spit in the idol and after made the sign of the
cross in their foreheads, and kissed each other, and
received capital sentence, that is to say they were
beheaded‚ and so suffered death under Alexander
the emperor, which began to reign the year of our
Lord two hundred and twenty. And anon after
Carpasius was taken of the fiend in blaspheming

’ his gods and in magnifying the christian men

against his will, he was sti-angled of the fiend,
which thing his wife seeing, called Armenia, with
her daughter Lucina and all her household received
baptism of S. Fortunatus, priest. And after that

{he- godies of the saints were right honorably
urie .

Here followeth the Lg'ft’ (gf S. Pernelle, and first

the interpretation (ff her name.

Petronilla is said of petens, that is demanding,
and of tronus, that is a throne or a seat, as who
saith she was demanding the throne or seat of
virgins.
