16 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The Life lady he went to battle. S. Basil awoke all affrayed‚
0f,S· and went to the tomb where the knight was buried
13:¹²³th in, and opened the sepulchre, but he found neither
body ne arms. Then he demanded of the
keeper who had taken away the body. And he
sware that in the even tofore it was there. S.
Basil after on the morn returned, and found the
body and the armour and the spear all bloody.
And anon came one from the battle which said
that Julian the apostata and emperor was in the
battle, and thither came a knight unknown all
armed with his spear, which hardily smote his
horse with his spurs and came to Julian the
emperor, and brandished his sword and smote him
through the body, and suddenly he departed and
never after was seen again. And yet when he
should die he took his hand full of blood and cast
it into the air saying: Thou hast vanquished man
of Galilee! thou hast overcome! And in crying
thus, miserably he expired, and died in great pain,
and was left without sepulture of all his men.
And he was flayed of the Persians, and of his skin
was made to the king of Persia an undercovering,
and thus he died cursedly.
Thus end the Lives of four ἰγοζγ saints every each

named Julian, and osone that was a false apostata.

Here followeth the Lffi? qs S . [gnatius bishop, and first

the interpretation of his name.

Ignatius is said as one suffering fire and burning,
for he was embraced and all esprised of the divine
and burning love of God.
