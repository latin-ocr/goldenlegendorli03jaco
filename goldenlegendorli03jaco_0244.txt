232 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The Liyes part to the great adventures that were in that time.

Οὲὃᾶωῗε And S. Austin rehearseth in the book of the City

ervg‘tffi of God that he was present, and the emperor and

prm-,hage much great company, when that a blind man

received his sight at Milan at the bodies of

Gervase and Prothase‚ but it is not known
whether it was the same blind man or no.

Also he telleth in the same book that there was

a young man in a town named Victoriana rode his

horse into a river that lay thereby‚ and as soon as

he was therein the devil strangled him and threw

him in the water all dead, and whiles they sang

evensong in a church of S. Gervase and Prothase,

which was thereby, he was so smitten with the

voices ot them that sang that he started up alive,

and in a great haste he entered into the church in

a great dread, and held fast by the altar like as he

had been bounden theret03 then the devil menaced

him, and said if he would not come thence he

would break all his members, and a little while

after, by the merits of the holy martyrs he was

plainly healed. And S. Ambrose saith in his

preface: These be they that by the heavenly

banner took the arms of the apostles and van-

quished and have the victory, and be assoiled from

the suares of the world, they destroyed the fellow-

ship of the fiend and followed freely without any

empeshment our Lord Jesu Christ, like unto a

debonair fraternity that so learned the holy words

that no filth was meddled among them. O how

glorious a strife was this that causeth them both to

be crowned in heaven like as they issued out of

one belly. ’
