THE GOLDEN LEGEND 287

Jesu Christ saith clearly, in the gospel, that none The Life
may enter into the kingdom of heaven if he be ⁰f S· ,
not regenerate of water and of the Holy Ghost, Genevoeve
that is to say, regenerate by the sacrament of
baptism. By this scripture, and by semblable, the
holy prelates destroyed· their false creance and
belief, and by virtue also and by miracles, for in a
solemnity of Easter, by many that were new
baptized, in singing Alleluia they chased and drove
away their enemies of Scotland, and strangers
of other places, that were come for to grieve
them.

It happed on a day that Geronce, the mother
of the holy maid Genevieve, went on an holy and
festal day toward the minster, and her daughter went
after, saying that the faith that she had promised to
S. Germain she should keep by the help of God,
and that she should oft go to the minster to the
end that she might desire to be the espouse of
Jesu Christ, and that she might be worthy of his
love. The mother was angry and smote her on
the cheek. God avenged the child that the
mother became blind, and that in twenty—one
months she saw not. When the mother had been
long in this pain, which much annoyed her, she
remembered of the goodness that &Germain had
said of her daughter, and called her and said:
My daughter, go to the pit and fetch me water3
the maid went hastily3 when she was at the pit
she began to weep because her mother had lost
her sight for her sake, and took up water and bare
it to her mother. The mother stretched her
hands to heaven, and took the water with great
saith and reverence, and made her daughter to
sign her with the sign of the holy cross and wash
her eyes, and anon she began for to see a little.
