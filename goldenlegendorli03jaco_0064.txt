52 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

‚The men, women, and children, and also Theophilus,
Chall'ing the lord and provost of the city, to whom S. Peter
Petessftffg had raised his son which had been fourteen years

Apostle dead. And some say that of his palace he made
a church in the which all the people set up a chair
<for S. Peter to sit in more higher‚ for to preach
{the doctrine of Jesu Christ, and the better to be
‘heard and seen. And of the exalting thus of S.
’ Peter into this chair, this feast taketh the name of
;the chairing of S. Peter. And in this church was
ffS. Peter seven years, and from thence he went
to Rome and governed the church of Rome
twenty-five years. That other reason why this
feast was established was for the reverence of the

city of Antioch, the paynims sheared him upon his

And because this was done to S. Peter to do him
despite and shame, it was sith stablished that the
clergy should have his crown shaven in sign of
right great honour and authority. And it is to wit
that in the crown be three things: first the head is
discovered and bare above and the hair cut away,
and the crown is round. There be ,PhE?P,...E.ss3§QDS
