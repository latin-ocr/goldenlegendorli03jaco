258 THE GoLDEN LEGE'ND

‘The father'sname, Zacharias. The mother said that

Natlvsty he should be named John, and not Zacharias, and

of {gt-122¹} they went unto the father and said that there was

p none in that kindred that so was called. And

then the father demanded pen and ink, and wrote:

J ohannes est nomen ejus, John is his name, and all

they marvelled. Anon after, by the merit of S.

John, his father's mouth was opened, and had

again his speech, and spake, glorifying our Lord

God. And these tidings of this holy child thus

born, were anon spread all about the country, and

each man said in his beart, and without forth one to

another: What suppose ye shall be of this child?

He shall be great and a man of our Lord, for he is

already now with him, and the hand, the work,

and the virtue of our Lord is with him. The

father, holy Zacharias, replenished with the Holy

Ghost, said and prophesied, and made then the

holy psalm: Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel,
which psalm is always sung in the end of matins.

It is said that holy Zacharias dwelled upon the

mountains two miles nigh to Jerusalem, and there

S. John Baptist was born, and after that S. John

was circumcised, he was nourished as a child of a

noble and rich man and son of great dignity, but

when· he had understanding and strength of body,

God our Lord and the heart performed the work.

He issued out of his father’s house, and left riches,

honours, dignities, noblesse, and all the world, and

’ went into desert on ,flQn-JQJLd-le Some say he

went in the age of fifteen years accomplished, and

others say he departed at twelve years of age for

to serve our Lord without gmpgshmen't, by which

he kept silence, and „hydyyffljge his life and his sou]

from idle words. This holy S. John, dwelling in

desert, ware apha1rmadqoftl2eha1r ofecamels.
