246 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The Lives suffered all their reprools, and the people were
Of {²³3¹ss so great a multitude that they occupied all the
aad A& place, which was large and great. And the heat
‘phiabel of the sun was so great that it burnt and scalded
their feet as they went, and so they led him till

they came to a swift running river, where they

might not lightly pass for press of people‚ for many

were shifted over the bridge into the water and

were drowned, and many, because they might not

go over the bridge for press‚ unclothed them for

to swim over the river, and some that could not

swim presumed to do the same, and were wretchedly
drowned, whereof was a great rumour and noise
piteously among the people. And when S. Alban
perceived this thing he bewailed and wept for the

harm and death of his enemies that so were
perished, and kneeled down holding his hands up

to God beseeching that the water might be lessed

and the flood withdrawn that the people might be

with him at his passion, and forthwith God showed

at the request of S. Alban a fair miracle, for the

water withdreW‚ and the river dried up in such

wise that the people might safely go dry foot over

the river, and also by the prayer of this holy man,

they that tofore had been drowned were restored

again to life, and were found alive in the deepness

of the river. And then one of the knights that

drew S. Alban toward his martyrdom‚ saw these
miracles that God showed for him, and anon threw

away his sword and fell down at the feet of S.

Alban, saying: I knowledge to God mine error

and demand forgiveneSS‚ and wept sore and said:

O Albam servant of God, for verily thy God is
almighty and there is none God but he, and there-

fore I knowledge me to be his servant during my

life, for this river by thy prayers is made dry,
