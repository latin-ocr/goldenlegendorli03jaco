168 THE GoLDEN LEGEND

The two years, Titus took Jerusalem and destroyed all,
Llfe 0f and the temple als03 and like as the Jews had
S James bought our Lord for thirty pence, so gave he
thirty Jews for one penny. And like as Josephus

perished by famine and by sword. It is read

that when Titus entered Jerusalem he saw a Β

thick wall which he did do perish and break,

some Jews would re-edify Jerusalem. And on

the first morning that they went to work they

found crosses on the dew, and then they fied, and

after they came again and began to re-edify again,
