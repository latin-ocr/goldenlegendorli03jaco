68 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

The Life justice and have the merit thereof 'of God than an-
0f S· other have it for thee? Then had Trajan pity and
tgregory deseended from his horse and did justice in aveng-

went by the market of Rome which is called the
market of Trajan, and then he remembered of

the justice and other good deeds of Trajan, and
how he had been piteous and debonair, and was
rnuch ,sorrowful that he had been) a paynim, and

he turned to the church· of S. Peter wailing for
