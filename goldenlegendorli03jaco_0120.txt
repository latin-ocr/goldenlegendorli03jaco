108 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

,The had thus prayed, and to our blessed Lady thus
Sol-‘ffizz‘ffgrfaithfully promised, I went again to the doors of

of Egypt

the church, and without any impediment I entered

into the church. And when I had devoutly

,, worshipped and adored the holy cross, a man gave

{to me three peuce, of which I bought three loaves of

sbread. And after, Ι heard anon a voice: If thou

³wilt pass and go over flom Jordan thou shalt be

'safe, and then Ι passed Jordan, and came into this

J desert, where Ι never saw man by the space of seven-

ξ teen years. These “three Ioaves,'⁷that Ἰ 'bare ‘with

x ν „ 2155, 'became' hard, by the drought of the time, as a

stone, of which Ι took my sustenance‚ and sufficed
to me seventeen years, and after, I ate herbS. My
clothes be rotten long sith, and these seventeen first
years I was much tempted by the burning of the
sun much aspoely, and many delectations that Ι have
had in meat and drink, the good wines, and doing
the desires of my body, all these came in my
thought. Then Ι bewailed them on the earth, and
prayed for help to our blessed Lady in whom Ι had

„set all my affiance, and I wept much tenderly.

And anon Ι saw coming about me a great light,
by the which Ι was all recomforted, and lost all

„the thoughts which oft and grievously tempted me.

And sith, Ι have been delivered of all temptations
and am nourished of spiritual meat of the word

&of our Lord. And thus have I been all my life

as I have told to thee, and I pray thee by the
incarnation of Jesu Christ that thou pray for me,
sinful creature. Then the old father Zosimus fell
down unto ground, and thanked our Lord God

μ that had thus saved his servant. And she said:
l, Ι pray thee fair father that thou wilt come again
