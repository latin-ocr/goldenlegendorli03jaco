THE GOLDEN LEGEND

Herefhlloweth of S. Pauline the W idow

S. Pauline was a much noble widow of Rome, The Life
of whom S. J erome wrote the life, and saith first 0f S..
thus : If all my members were turned into tongues, Panlme
and all my arteries should resound in human jsCf „³11³
voice, yet I might not worthily write the virtues ¹
of S. Pauline. I take witness of God and of his
holy angels‚ and also of the angel that was keeper
of this woman that I shall say nothing for praising
but that same that I shall say shall be less than
appert‘aineth to her virtues. ’ She was born among
the nobles of the senators of Rome, and of the
lineage of the noble Gregois, rich of good and
puissant of seignory at Rome. She was the most
humble of all other, for like as the sun surmounteth
the clearness of the stars, so surmounted she the
beauty of others by her great humility.

When her husband was passed out of this world,
she abode lady of all the goods and riches. It
happed that, at the mandment of the Emperor,
many bishops came 'to Rome, among whom were
there the holy man Paulinus, the patriarch of
Antioch, and Epiphanius, bishop of Cyprus, of
whom she was esprised in good virtues, so that
she gave largely of her goods for God's sake.

Her parentS, ne her friends, ne her own children
could not turn her, ne make her to change her
