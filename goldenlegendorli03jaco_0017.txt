THE GOLDEN LEGEND 5

fair and gay against the commandment of God, and The Life
the body ought to be chastised that hath had so ⁰f S.-
much solace in this world, and the laughings ought paulme
to be recompensed by weepings, and the soft bed

and the sheets ought to be changed into the sharp-

ness of hair. Ι that was accustomed to please

man and the world, Ι desire now to please Jesu
Christ. And what shall I say of chastity in
which she was ensample unto all ladies of time

past when she was yet secular ? For she conversed

in such wise that they that were envious durst not

avise on her any evil fame. She was debonair

and courteous unto all, for she comforted the poor

and warned the rich to do well, but in largess she
passed so that no poor man complained of her.

And this did she not by the great abundance that

she had of goods, but by her wise governance,

and when Ι said to her that she should have
measure in doing alms‚ after that the apostle saith

that, the alms that is done to another be not grievous

to him that doth it. But she said that for the love

of our Lord she did all, and that she desired to

die, begging in such wise that she should not leave

one penny to her daughter after her, and that she

might be wrapped in a strange sheet when she

should die.
And at the last she said: If Ι should demand

ought, I should find enough that would give to
me, and these beggars, if I gave to them nought
and they so departed and died for poverty‚ of
whom should God demand this ? Oft said she so :
They be happy that be merciful, and alms quencheth
sins as the water quencheth the fire, but for to do
alms it cometh not always to perfection‚ for many
do alms that abide in their carnalities, they seem to
be· good without forth, but within they be mortal.
