The Life
of S.
Patrick

76 THE GOLDEN LEGEND

and an half the devil appeared to him on a time,
which was in his orisons, and said to him that
there should be great destruction of his brethren‚
but the angel of our Lord came after him which
recomforted him, and then he came unto the
brethren and said to them that he and many of
them therewithin should pass out of this world.
And it happed that within a month after, there
died one hundred and sixteen monks of that abbey,
and of all the number there abode no more alive
but twenty-four. And then died Anthonin and
Constantine that were come with him. A little
while after died S. Maur of the pain of his side,
the forty-first year after he was come thither,
the eighteenth calends of February, and he died
tofore the altar of S. Martin, where he was covered
with an hair. The other of his fellowship returned
to Mount Cassin, and thus accomplished this
blessed saint his life in the time of Louis the
emperor the second. And the body ot S. Maur
was borne from the abbey in Angers, named Glan-
feuil, for fear of the Normans, unto the abbey of
S. Peter des Fosses where his body is οων,
which abbey founded S. Banolanis disciple to S.
Columbain. His feast is the fifteenth day of

J anuary.

Here followeth the Lifi² of S. Patrick, and the inter-

pretation of his name.

Patrick is as much to say as knowledge, for by
the will of God he knew many of the secrets of
heaven and* of the joys there, and also he saw a
part of the pains of hell.
